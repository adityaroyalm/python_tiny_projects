calcuate the skewness of integers data
clculate the describe 
draw violin plot a combination of density and box plots ,a multiple subplots of matplotlib were drawn before that
matplotlib is great for subplotting
#########skew correction##
we can also draw a pairplot iteratively by mentioning x_vars,y_vars iteratvely unlike just mentioning the dataset 
plot countplot of categorical data in the dataset

one hot encoding of categorical data
lists of lists of categorical data in each column of the dataset
use LabelEncoder().fit(list[listt]).transform(data.iloc[:,i])
OneHotEncoder
cross_validation.train_test_split
data preparation##########
evaluation,prediction and analysis
linear regression




notes------------------
*in seaborn parameters for countplot,violinplot are x='name of column'
* we can create lists of lsts by appending
* we can create a 2d array from a list of arrays by column_stack
